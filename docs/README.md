## Introduction
For every button press the chance of a reset will be increased by one percentage point. Be lucky and get as far as you can. On the bottom of the page there is a chart with the amount of tries visualizing how often how far you came (may take some tries to be properly visualizable).

I think I got this idea from a TikTok video but not in a direct way. After thinking about it for some time, I just made it. Unfortunately a couple of months later I found basically the same game as a paid version on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2026850/THE_BUTTON__Golden_Button/).

If you still want to try your luck and see how far it takes you press [here](https://rolanddaum.github.io/GambleClick/) or go to https://rolanddaum.github.io/GambleClick/

## Probability
For everyone who is interested in the stochastic Maths part of this, here is a chart that shows the probability of an increase on the Y-Axis and the amount of clicks in decimal on the X-Axis.

For reference, here is a screenshot of the chart from the game after something like 10K runs.

Aside from the fact that the X-Axis is mirrored, we can clearly see that the probability chart is an integral of the percentage chart and vice versa as a derivative graph.
The gradient from the first chart can be seen as a value in the second one.
